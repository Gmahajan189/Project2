Project Name: Data Acquistion and Wrangling

Description: Data wrangling was performed on the set of datasets. The different methods employed for doing data wrangling were: Merging the datasets, dropping out unnecessary columns, checking the datatypes,summary and dimensions of the dataset, treated the missing values, identified the outliers and checked the skewness,correlation of the data. Box-plots were constructed for visualising the data after treating the outliers and high skew columns were transformed using logarithmic transformtion. Heatmap was used for visualising

Dependencies: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries were employed in the project
Pandas: Data manipulation library that provides data structures like DataFrames for easy handling and analysis of structured data.
NumPy: Fundamental library for the numerical computing in Python, offering powerful array objects and mathematical functions for array operations.
Matplotlib: Comprehensive plotting library for creating static, interactive, and publication-quality visualizations in Python.
Seaborn: Statistical data visualization library that works well with Pandas and Matplotlib, offering high-level functions for creating informative statistical plots.
